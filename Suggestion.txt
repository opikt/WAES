Suggestions for Improvement

1. Create an API that can do a multiple calculation in one time.
2. Better validation in parameters (e.g. can use relative paths, etc.)
3. Create a function / using the library that can push the hardware limitation during the calculation. 
For now, the calculation still quite slow.
